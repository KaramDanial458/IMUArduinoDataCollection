# IMUArduinoDataCollection
Please feel free to use this code if you need to keep track of accelerometer and gyro data :)

Serial data is transmitted at a Baud rate of 9600, which should be friendly enough for your average Arduino. This code takes in xyz motion by reading in serial data 8 bits at a time. Plug in your IMU, upload the code, and move the Arduino around while watching the Serial monitor. You should see values changing with your movements
